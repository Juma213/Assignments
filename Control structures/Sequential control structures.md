Notes
A sequential control structure is the simplest form of control flow. In a sequential control structure, statements are executed one after another in the order they appear in the code. There are no jumps, loops, or conditions that alter the flow of execution.

Key Points:
- Statements are executed one after another.

- The order of execution is the same as the order of appearance in the code.

- It does not involve any decision-making or repetition.

Example:
 print("This is the first statement.")
 x = 5 + 3
 print("The value of x is:", x)
 y = x * 2
 print("The value of y is:", y)
Explanation:
First, the program prints the text "This is the first statement."

Then program calculates the sum of 5 and 3, assigns it to `x`, and prints the value of `x`.

Last, the program multiplies the value of `x` by 2, assigns it to `y`, and prints the value of `y`.

In the above example, each statement is executed one after another in the order they appear. There are no conditions or loops that would alter this order.

Usage in Real Programs:
Sequential control structures are used in situations where a specific sequence of operations is required. This could be initializing variables, performing calculations, or printing output. They form the backbone of any program, even those that make use of more complex control structures like loops and conditionals.
