Notes
An exception is an event which can occur during the execution of a program and disrupt normal flow of the program. 

Difference between syntax errors and exceptions:
Syntax Errors:
  - Occur when the Python interpreter encounters incorrect syntax.

  - Detected during the parsing stage, before the program starts running.

  - Prevent the code from executing at all.

  - Example: Missing a colon at the end of a for loop statement.

    for i in range(5)  # SyntaxError: missing colon
        print(i)
Exceptions:
  - Occur during program execution when the interpreter detects an operation that it cannot execute.

  - Can be caught and handled using exception handling techniques.

  - Allow the program to continue running after addressing the issue.

  - Example: Trying to divide by zero or accessing an index out of range.

    print(10 / 0)  # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
Common types of exceptions:
- ValueError:
  - Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.

  - Example: Converting a non-numeric string to an integer.

    int("abc")  # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
-TypeError:
  - Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.

  - Example: Adding a string to an integer.

    "hello" + 5 # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
- IndexError:
  - Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range for a sequence (like a list or tuple).

  - Example: Accessing an element in a list using an out-of-bounds index.

    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    print(my_list[5])  # IndexError: list index out of range
Why is Exception handling important in programming?
Exception handling is crucial because it helps ensure that a program can handle unexpected situations gracefully, rather than crashing or producing incorrect results. By managing exceptions effectively, programmers can:

- Improve program robustness: By anticipating and handling potential errors, programs become more reliable and less likely to fail unexpectedly.

- Enhance user experience: Users receive meaningful error messages and can continue using the application without interruption.

- Simplify debugging: Clear and specific error handling makes it easier to identify and fix issues in the code.

 
Understanding these basic concepts and types of exceptions will help you effectively handle errors in your Python programs, leading to more robust and user-friendly applications.
